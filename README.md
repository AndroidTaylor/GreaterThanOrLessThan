# GreaterThanOrLessThan
Takes two numbers assigned by the user, and compares the first one to the second (>, &lt;, or =) and displays the result in a way that looks like a seven segment display.



(Slightly more detail)
This takes a very basic program I wrote in CS121 earlier today, and adds onto it. 
The program just took two numbers assigned by the user, and said if the first one was >, <, or = to the second number. 
For fun, I added a simple gui with tkinter 
(I used this as a way to learn a bit) 
and used the canvas to kind of brute force a "display" that resembles a seven segment display.
